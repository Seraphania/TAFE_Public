# Joining Tables
Portfolio Exercise

## Brief
Complete the tasks below:
1. Create, in SQL, a simple database for a file system on a computer. It should have two tables - folders and files - in a one-to-many relationship. Both should store name, date last accessed, date last changed and date created. Files should also have a file size.
2. Create a few quick records and, again, copy the queries into a document.
3. Create and test each of the following queries, copying each into the document. If any have no results, add at least two records that will be returned by the query. 
   
   Some experimentation may be required with left, right and inner joins to figure out which is appropriate in each case. Be careful to display all the information asked for and no more.
   1. Display all the names of all the files in a given folder.
   2. Display all the names of all the files in a given folder ordered by creation date.
   3. Display the folder name and file names for files in a given folder.
   4. Display the folder name and file names for files in a given folder if they havenâ€™t been accessed this year.
   5. Display all folders and what files they contain, even if they contain none.
   6. Display all folders and what files they contain, even if they contain none. Sort by file size.
   7. Display all the files and what folders they are in.
   8. Display all the files and what folders they are in. Sort alphabetically by folder name and then file size.
